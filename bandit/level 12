We already have access to this level using the password : 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

Let's try beating level 13 !

Hints : The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory 
under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

PS : that's a lot of talk hehehe !
