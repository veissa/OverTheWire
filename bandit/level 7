We already have access to this level using the password : morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

let's try beat level 8 !

________________________________________________________

Clues : The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

________________________________________________________

To solve this we'll be using the powereful "grep" and the cat command to look for the password in the large data.txt file :

________________________________________________________

bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep "millionth"
millionth       dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
________________________________________________________

Bingo ! this should work now !
