Bingo ! , we somehow did it , using the ls -als , displays more info while listing the contents of a directory , it displays the permessions , the owners , group owners , size ,
modification dates and the name of the files , we all know that a directory or file starting with " . " means it is hidden , that is why the ls command won't be capable of displaying it .

here is a break down of this line : 4 -rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Jul 17 15:57 ...Hiding-From-You 

>    4: This is the number of hard links to the file. It indicates how many directory entries reference this file.

>    -rw-r-----: This is the file's permission string. It shows the permissions for the file in three sets:
     >   -: The first character indicates the file type. A dash (-) means it is a regular file.
     >  rw-: The next three characters are the owner's permissions (read and write).
     >   r--: The next three characters are the group's permissions (read-only).
     >  ---: The last three characters are the permissions for others (no permissions).

>    1: This is the number of hard links to the file.

>   bandit4: This is the owner of the file.

>    bandit3: This is the group owner of the file.

>    33: This is the size of the file in bytes.

>    Jul 17 15:57: This is the date and time when the file was last modified.

>    ...Hiding-From-You: This is the name of the file.

--> Putting it all together, this line indicates that the file named ...Hiding-From-You:

    Is a regular file.
    Has read and write permissions for the owner (bandit4), read-only permissions for the group (bandit3), and no permissions for others.
