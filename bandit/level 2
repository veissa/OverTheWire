as you can see , to display the contents of the file that is named with spaces on it "spaes in this name" for exapmple , doing the usual cat , will not work , as it will treat each of the words as a different file
for example , it will consider spaces a file , in a file , this a file , and name a file too ! 
hence we used the "" to indicate that it is just the name of one single file we are trying to cat . bingo !
